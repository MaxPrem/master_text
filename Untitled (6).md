Diffuse reflectance is nowadays the most used solid sample measurement in NIRS, and it is, undoubtedly, one of the reasons responsible for NIRS popularity. Diffuse reflectance was first attempted in the mid-infrared spectral region when the Fourier transform (FT) instruments become available, owing to the works of Peter Grifftins on diffuse reflectance infrared Fourier transform (DRIFT) spectroscopy [13]. Later, the same researcher helped extend the technique to the near infrared spectral region [14].
