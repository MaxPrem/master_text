# NIR Examples:

Raman:

transfer learning to improve Raman pee sample classification


1. Reproduce CNN results from RRUD database
2. Gather large labeled database if possible
3. Gather spectra from small set of clinically labeled urine samples
4. Gather spectra from large unlabeled set of urine samples
5. Build Semi Supervised DCGAN using RRUD feature bottleneck as convolutions within Discriminator, add Dense layers and Softmax mapping to classes of all clinical states plus “generated”
